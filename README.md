hi there. i'm a human named matthew phillips living in the 21st century on rocky, warm planet named Earth, located on the inner edge of what we huamns call the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy. 

in what seems to me now to be a previous life, i was a fledgling scholar of french history and art, specializing in contemporary literature, cinema and visual art. i received my master's degree from Columbia's Reid Hall campus in Paris, was a visiting student at Universit√© de Paris-7-Diderot and spent 1 year as a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania before deciding to make a drastic career change.

currently, i'm a software engineer with a deep interest in / passion for: infosec, golang, scala, rust, and containers/container orchestration.

in my free time, i like reading about various topics such as the various offshoots of information theory, the neuroscience of consciousness, developments in post-Standard model physics, non-Copenhagen interpretations of quantum mechanics, the philosophy of mathematics, non-dualistic philosophies and theologies, and history (European, central Eurasian and Southeast Asian in particular).
